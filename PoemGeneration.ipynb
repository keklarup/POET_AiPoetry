    "1. Run each of the start up cells at the top of the notebook by selecting the cell and pressing either the play button on the screen or SHIFT+ENTER\n",
    "2. Pick which of the 2 different ways you want P.O.E.T to write a poem:\n",
    " * Probabalistic (random results)\n",
    " * Augmented (you help pick the words)\n",

    "In addition to unstemmed words, P.O.E.T. also uses the following 3 tokens when writing a poem:\n",
    "* starttoken   -- identifies the start of a poem. Often come in pairs b/c of how training was performed. \n",
    "* returntoken  -- identifies the end of a line in the poem ('\\n').\n",

    "#### Caveats: This project is still a work in progress. The current P.O.E.T. model is a shallow first prototype trained on a relatively small amount of data. "
